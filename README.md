### What is this repository for? ###

This Repo Is For the WaPesLeague MixBot
The Bot will run in discord and make it easy to sign in and out of a mix room.
A mix room is a 11 vs 11 football game room to which players can subscribe to a position.
The bot manages the creation and closing of the rooms aswell aswell as the user interactions to that room.

### How does it work? ###

This is a web application that will run the .Bot project.
It will spin up a hostedservice to run the bot that listens to Discord commands
We connect to discord with the DSharpPlus package.
