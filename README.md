### What is this repository for? ###

This Repo Is For the WaPesLeague MixBot
The Bot will run in discord and make it easy to sign in and out of a mix room.
A mix room is a 11 vs 11 football game room to which players can subscribe to a position.
The bot manages the creation and closing of the rooms aswell as the user interactions to that room.

### How does it work? ###

We connect to discord with the DSharpPlus package.
